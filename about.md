Hi, I'm Ally, a software developer, audiovisual technician, and electronic musician.

Below are some of my technical skills:

## Software

I'm confident using:

- Python 3
- C#
- JavaScript (as well as HTML & CSS)
- PowerShell
- Bash
- Lua

And I'm also confident using tools like Git & GitHub to help with my workflow.

## Audiovisual

I have experience working with lighting, projection and audio in theatres and event venues.
I've used and am confident with the following technologies:

- TouchDesigner v99
- DMX512 (as well as most common fixtures)
- Artnet and sACN
- The OSC protocol, OSC//PAR, and TouchOSC
- MIDI

## Music

I'm primarily producing techno, with a bit of progressive house mixed in, but I'm open to other genres.

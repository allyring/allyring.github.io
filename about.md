Hi, I'm Ally, a cyber-security student, software developer, and audiovisual technician.

Below are some of my skills:

## Cyber Security

I'm learning cyber security through TryHackMe, and I have finished the "complete beginner", "pre-security" and "intro to cyber security" courses.  
I have also previously completed the SANS Foundations course.

## Software

I'm currently learning C# for an A-Level computer science course, and I am also learnign Go for personal projects.

I'm also confident using Python 3 and JavaScript, as well as the basics of tools like Git & GitHub in my workflow.

## Audiovisual

I volunteer at a local arts venue, where I am responsible for stage lighting, film projection, and general technical support for live events.

During my time there, I've had the opportunity to work on a show for Grammy-winninng artist Albert Lee; folk artists Reg Meuross and Steve Knightly; and many other local and regional bands.  
I've also done lighting for conference, charity, and educational events.

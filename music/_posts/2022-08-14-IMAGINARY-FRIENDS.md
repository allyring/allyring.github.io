Ever since I stumbled into electronic music, my influences have ranged from Skrillex to Enrico Sangiuliano.
However, I've probably been a fan of deadmau5's (Joel Zimmerman's) music for longer than most other artists. From 'Avaritia' to 'XYZ', his style and techniques have influenced the way I create electronic music.  

However, one track in particular has always stood out to me as being the most influential to me, and that is 'Imaginary Friends'.

Imaginary Friends is the 6th track off of Zimmerman's 8th studio album, W://2016ALBUM, and it's always stood out to me for its arpeddgiator heavy introduction and breaks, its calm outro segment, and its catchy drop. However, it stands out for one other notable reason: the entire track was produced on a [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK8xxk0_lWkpfQhlbEOa3Vr0TFTcpS0LM).  

This fact makes it an invaluable resource in learning just how he approaches music production. For instance, the arpeddgiated intro, what I consider to be the core of the track, came from an older idea for a track named 71c. After shifting the root note of each chord of 71c's lead down by a few semitones, the arpeddgiated lead used was created.

The synth patch used is comprised of a saw wave made up of 16 voices of unison, which goes through a low pass filter connected to an envelope with no attack and short decay that controls the filter cutoff to create a plucky sound. This patch is modulated throughout, with the amount of filter modulation from the envelope, the filter cutoff, and the detune of those 16 voices all being affected.

Below is a simple recreation of that patch in Vital, a wavetable synthesiser that's similar to Serum, the synth used in Imaginary Friends:

The outro segment was taken from another unreleased track, called '[Entropy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM4ya29eEL8)'

The element from that track that was lifted was a bell sound from an Omnisphere preset as well as the melody used, which was pasced at the end of the track with little modification. This is a clear example of deadmau5 using a technique which he has dubbed 'Mr. Potatohead music', where he uses elements of other tracks he has written previously that typically haven't been finished that have been saved as 'clips' in Ableton Live to create new music.

Another example of him using this technique can be found in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HlU1R97RF4) live stream clip.

The bass used in each drop is comprised of a sine wave and an FM wavetable that is modulated by another sine wave transposed down 3 octaves. The FM wavetable's wavetable position is modulated with an envelope with no attack and medium decay.
